# Pathfinder - Swift Playground

This Swift Playground was created as part of my submission for the WWDC19 scholarships.

The playground contains code that makes use of the Dijkstra and A* algorithms to plan a route through a maze. Next to these two different path planning algorithms, it also implements two heuristic functions (euclidean distance and manhattan distance).
